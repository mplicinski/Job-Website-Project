Matching algorithm - Initial idea

Point system for matching

Companies will see in the order the seekers with the most points to the least points for a job
Seekers will see in order which jobs they scored the highest points for

Technical skills based off of 1-5 scale of familiarity 
Business skills based off of years of experience
Cultural values work as tags (Must have at least one tag to be matched)

Companies can set a greater importance on either tech & business skills OR cultural values for a job post.
	This will set the weight of points from chosen category to be greater than the other
	For example:
		If a company sets a greater importance on cultural values
		Then the points the employee gets from cultural value points will be given a weight of 70%
		And the points the employee get from technical skill points will be given a weight of 30%
			And vice versa

If a job is NOT remote
	A high amount of points will be given if a seeker lives in the same city as the company location. 30 points
	A smaller amount of point will be given if a seeker lives in the same state as the company. 15 points
	This is to weed out seekers who are not near the job
		? Possible addition: seeker could indicate that they are willing to relocate and get some points. 20 points 

For cultural tags
	If seeker has at least 1 matching tag with company they will be added to the list of possible candidates
	For each matching tag the seeker will be given 10 points

For job post tech skill
	If a seeker meets minimum skill level they gain 5 points
		and if importance level >= 4 seeker gains bonus points for meeting minimum skill level.
			bonus points = importance level/2
	If a seeker meets minimum skill level-1 they gain 3 points
	If a seeker meets minimum skill level-2 they gain 1 point

For job post business skill
	If a seeker exceeds minimum year of experience they gain 4 points
		and extra-years-of-experience / 3 points
		extra-years-of-experience = seeker total years of experience - minimum years
	If a seeker meetings minimum years of experience they gains 4 points
		and if importance level >= 4 seeker gains bonus points
	If a seeker meets minimum years of experience-1 they gain 2 points
